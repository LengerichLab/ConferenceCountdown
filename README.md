# ConferenceCountdown
Webpage used to countdown time until conference deadlines.

I work in the ML/Compbio space, so the conferences listed in [js/conferences_db.js](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/blob/main/js/conferences_db.js) are focused on those themes.

You can view the website live at [http://web.mit.edu/~blengeri/www/deadlines.shtml](http://web.mit.edu/~blengeri/www/deadlines.shtml).

Feel free to suggeest updates by [making an issue](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/issues) on this repo, or host your own version!
