# ConferenceCountdown
Webpage used to countdown time until conference deadlines.
You can view the website live at [https://web.mit.edu/~blengeri/www/deadlines.shtml](http://web.mit.edu/~blengeri/www/deadlines.shtml).


I work in the ML/Compbio space, so these conferences are focused on those themes.

Feel free to suggest updates by [making an issue](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/issues) on this repo, making a pull request with changes to [js/conferences_db.js](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/blob/main/js/conferences_db.js), or even hosting your own version!
