# ConferenceCountdown
Webpage used to countdown time until conference deadlines.

It uses the information in[conferences.csv](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/blob/main/conferences.csv) to populate the countdown page.
I work in the ML/Compbio space, so the conferences currently listed in [conferences.csv](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/blob/main/conferences.csv) are focused on those themes, but the display will adapt to whatever is stored in that file.

Feel free to suggest updates by [making an issue](https://github.com/blengerich/ConferenceCountdown/issues) on this repo, making a pull request, or even hosting your own version!


## Live Example
You can view the website live on [my MIT homepage](https://web.mit.edu/~blengeri/www/deadlines.shtml).
